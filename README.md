# A karaoke desktop game

### Analogously to typing-based games (e.g. TypeRacer), a user is typing symbols [that are displayed] with the goal of typing as many symbols as possible; in the end, the score of the user is kept and is shown.
### However, contrary to the TypeRacer-like games, the user is actually limited in time for each line of displayed lyrics; i.e. you cannot type a line after the song has passed through it, and so you have to continue (just like in the real karaoke :) ).
### Here is the video demonstrating how to launch the application and how it works:
